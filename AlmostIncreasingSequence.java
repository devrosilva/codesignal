	Exercise solved at Codesignal.com

	Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing 
	sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

	Note: sequence a0, a1, ..., an is considered to be a strictly increasing if a0 < a1 < ... < an. Sequence 
	containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.
